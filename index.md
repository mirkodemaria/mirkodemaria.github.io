NOTE: THIS WEBSITE IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at Imperial College London. I am broadly interested in industrial organization, international trade, and health.

I received my MSc (with Distinction) in Economics from UCL in 2021. Prior to that, I receive my BSc summa cum laude from the Sapienza University of Rome.

Between 2021 and 2022, I was a pre-doctoral research fellow at Yale University's Department of Economics. Also at Yale, I was a graduate visiting student at the Department of Mathematics.
